This project's main purpose is to analyze whether Pennsylvania restaurants' stay open past an initial inspection. I wanted to know if a restaurant receiving a lower grade would result in a closure or if it would result in the resaturant working to fix its problems to stay open.
I used Python to visualize trends from the datasets that were used. A report is attached that states my findings.
